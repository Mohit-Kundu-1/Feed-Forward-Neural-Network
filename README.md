# Feed-Forward-Neural-Network
Creating a feed forward neural network from scratch and testing it

What is a Feed forward Neural Network(FNN)?
>A Feedforward Neural Network is an artificial neural network wherein connections between the nodes do not form a cycle.
>The feedforward neural network was the first and simplest type of artificial neural network devised.
>In this network, the information moves in only one direction, forward, from the input nodes, through the hidden nodes (if any)              and to the output nodes. There are no cycles or loops in the network.

In this repository, we will create a simple Feed forward Neural Network for binary classification of non-linearly seperable arbitary datset. This model will be compared to Sigmoid Neuron model on the same datset.

>For Sigmoid Neuron Model refer to - https://github.com/Mohit-Kundu-1/Sigmoid_Neuron_Model

Afterwards, we will model a more generic class of FNN with multi-class classification and will play around a little bit.
